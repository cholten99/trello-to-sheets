Register adoption as an example of "Trello to Google Sheets"

As is
  * The Register’s adoption engagement tracker trello
  * The Register’s overview google sheet
  * The “adoption” tab lists every service and various information about the stage of adoption
  * The “use by register” tab list lists every register and which services are (or may in future) use it
* The “engagement” tab lists every organisation and which of their services we’re working with

Proposed - common
  * Define a standard format for description part of Trello cards so that it can be easily accessed programmatically
  * Have a standard format YAML file for Trello and Google Sheet credentials
  * Write a standard python object to store data for any Trello card (including breaking down the description into a dictionary)

Write library functions to:
  * Connect to any Trello board
  * Read all the cards in the board into an array of standard objects
  * Connect to any Google Sheet
  * Write test code using an example board and sheet

Proposed - specific
  * Write specific code to generate each of the 3 tabs in the Register’s overview sheet using the library functions
  * Implement on Heroku with a “cron job”

Proposed - generic
  * Write code that consumes a ‘code’ file that specifies how to map between any trello board and any sheet
  * Would require support for language constructs such as loops
